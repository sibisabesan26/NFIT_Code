
Earthquake Visualization Program
Overview
This Python program enables users to visualize earthquake data in Greece using interactive geographical scatter plots. The code uses Pandas for data manipulation and Plotly Express for creating dynamic visualizations.

Prerequisites
Python installed on your system.
Required Python libraries: Pandas, Plotly Express. You can install them using the following command:
Copy code
pip install pandas plotly
Usage Steps
Download the Code:

Download the Python script (earthquake_visualization.py) and the earthquake dataset (Earthquakes_v2.csv) to your local machine.
Install Required Libraries:

Open a terminal or command prompt and install the required libraries using the command mentioned in the "Prerequisites" section.
Run the Program:

Navigate to the directory containing the Python script and execute it using the following command:
Copy code
python earthquake_visualization.py
Input Start and End Dates:

The program will prompt you to enter the start and end dates for the earthquake data analysis. Input the dates in the format YYYY-MM-DD.
Explore the Visualization:

The program will generate an interactive geographical scatter plot displaying earthquake data in Greece for the specified date range. The plot includes animated timelines, with circle color and size representing earthquake magnitude.
Interact with the Plot:

Use the interactive features provided by Plotly Express to explore the plotted data. You can hover over data points, zoom in/out, and pan across the map.
Close the Plot:

Once you have explored the visualization, close the plot window to end the program.
